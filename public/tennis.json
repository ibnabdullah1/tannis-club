    "description2": "Definition of a Serve: In tennis, a serve (or service) is a shot used to start a point. The player uses a racquet to hit the ball in such a way that it falls into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net.",

If the ball hits the net but still goes into the proper service box, it's called a let, which is not a fault but not allowed in major tours.",
